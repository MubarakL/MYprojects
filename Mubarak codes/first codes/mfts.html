    <h1 style="margin-left: 4in;"><u>Hi, I'm Marc</u></h1>
    <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: larger; margin-left: 3.5in;">
        ...and I work for the next generation of makers.
        Tech is reshaping how we learn and come together. Software is ubiquitios
        and every person can now build their way to a future that inspires them.
        However, <strong>today's world isn't designed to work for these makers</strong> creating
        an imbalance between the impact they're capable of, and what's expected of
        them.
        I'm working to solve this problem... 
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc;" class="mftslist">
       <li>by creating better <strong>tools</strong> at <a href="https://sdui.de" style="color: pink;">Sdui</a> for education and formerly at <br><a href="https://hackerbay.com" style="color: pink;">Hackerbay</a> for hackers and companies;</li> 
       <li>by building <strong>communities</strong>, formerly as a co-founder of <a href="https://www.hackevents.co" style="color: pink;">Hackevents</a><br>organizing hackathons across Germany, now by mentoring at<br>hackathons around the world;</li>
       </ul> 
       ...and through one commit at a time.
       Currently, I am working as <strong>Head of Engineering</strong> at <a href="https://sdui.de" style="color: pink;">Sdu</a>. It's an amazing gig 
       where i get to work alomgside great developers on a software product that has
       become an integral medium upon which tens of thousands of teachers,
       parents and students rely to guarantee essential communication.

       I'm currently <strong>living in Helsinhi, Finland.</strong> Some other places I've lived in are 
       Berlin, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Toronto, and Munich.

       I'm a huge physics nerd, in particular cosmology. I wrote about the 
       accelerating expansion of the universe, or better known as Dark Energy <a href="https://www.mfts.io/psts/dark-energy" style="color: pink;">here</a>. 

       <h1 style="font-weight: lighter; margin-left: 0.4in;" id="previously"><u>Previously</u></h1>
       
       I founded and built <a href="https://hackerbay" style="color: pink;">Hackerbay</a> as CTO with three awesome friends. We took
       a small insight from hackathons-<em>software is not a 12 month development cycle</em> - 
       and built up a B2B company. We worked with Twitter, Vodafone, Allianz around 
       some of Germany's largest corporations. With <a href="https://nfx.com" style="color: pink;">NFX</a> we had incredible
       investors on board and always an open ear from James, Pete, or Gigi.

       After five years of immense personal and proffesional growth, priorities
       changed and we decided to pursue new opportunities, where each of our
       personal strengths are best put to use.
       
       For me tha's <strong>building tools for enabling the next billion developers.</strong>
